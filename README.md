Research Assistant – Frontend Prototype

## Idea

This project is a frontend prototype of a Research Assistant that helps users read research documents, ask questions, organize notes, and gain insights using AI (mocked responses). The focus is on UI/UX design and product thinking, not backend AI implementation.

## Target Users

- Students
- Researchers
- Engineers and professionals working with technical documents

---

## Core Problems

- Difficulty understanding complex research material
- Scattered notes and lack of organization
- No single interface to read, ask questions, and save insights
